//
// The above code should be used as the text for a URL within a browser's bookmark.
//
// The deconstruction of this bookmark follows:
// javascript:    <<<=== Tells browser that the next stuff should be executed as a JavaScript
//
// ( . . . )();   <<<=== This high level view is that the ellipses is the contents of an anonymous function
//
// function() {. . .}  <<<==== This mid-level view is the anonymous JavaScript function that contains JavaScript statements
//
// $.getScript("...url...", function(a,b,c){. . .});  <<<=== first and ONLY statement of anonymous function
//
// ...url...           <<<=== Actual web address of where your JavaScript code or application resides
// function(a,b,c){. . .}  <<<=== code that is executed IF $.getScript succeeds
// alert("$.getScript completed with a status = " + b);     <<<= Message to tell you that all is well
//
// Note. In this example, the initial version of bootBot.js also contained an alert that usually runs before the 
//       status message.  Eventually, bootBot.js was modified to load/invoke or pass control to a javascript 
//       that resides on the developer's PC.
