# tsBOT
A TypeScript version of basicBot for PlugDJ

This file is an ongoing design document.  basicBot, written in JavaScript is used as a design suggestion.
This TypeScript code is written from scratch but implements the functions of basicBot.

Features:
1. Define global (i.e. all users) parameters
2. Implement event processing:
   a. receive callbacks for some key press events
   b. receive callbacks for user commands
3. Implement user commands:
   a. roulette
   b. gif
   c. cat facts
   d. others per end-users

Goals for this Project
1. Design and code in TypeScript a functional equivalent of basicBot
2. Structure/modularize the TS
3. Develop test benches for critical code
4. Allow users to write their own extensions in JavaScript
